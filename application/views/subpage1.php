And hey, the unpleasing part of making it happen has always been the tedious process entailing it. Individual forms for every institute you wish to apply for. It is only natural to mistakenly end up leaving out a couple of details here and there. Or perhaps, forgetting to send in the photographs. The anomalies can be endless. You can now wipe all that stress right off. The application form we provide hjas a universal nature and it is all that you need to fill up to apply to multiple institutes.
